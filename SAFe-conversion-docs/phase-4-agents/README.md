# Phase 4: SAFe Agents & Responsibilities

## Goal
Create purpose-built agents that facilitate specific SAFe process steps and generate the required artifacts and documents.

## Overview
This phase designs agents based on the processes and templates defined in previous phases. Each agent is purpose-built for specific tasks, with clear context windows, responsibilities, and dependencies.
