# Phase 2: SAFe Templates & Artifacts

## Goal
Define all SAFe document types and their specifications to ensure consistent, high-quality outputs across the organization.

## Overview
This phase creates the templates and document specifications that will be used by agents to generate SAFe-compliant artifacts. Each template must align with SAFe best practices and provide clear guidance for content creation.
