# Phase 1: SAFe Foundation

## Goal
Create comprehensive SAFe knowledge base that serves as the foundation for all subsequent components.

## Overview
This phase establishes the domain knowledge, principles, and framework understanding that all other components will reference. It creates a single source of truth for SAFe practices and ensures consistency across the entire system.
