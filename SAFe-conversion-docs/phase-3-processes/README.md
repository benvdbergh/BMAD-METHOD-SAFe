# Phase 3: SAFe Processes & Information Flows

## Goal
Map how information flows through the organization and define the processes that connect different SAFe levels and artifacts.

## Overview
This phase defines the organizational processes and information flows that ensure smooth coordination between different SAFe levels. It establishes how work moves from enterprise vision to individual user stories and how feedback flows back up the organization.
