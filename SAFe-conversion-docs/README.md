# BMAD-Method SAFe Conversion Project

## Project Overview

This document tracks the systematic conversion of the BMAD-Method framework to fully implement SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) practices, processes, and artifacts.

## Implementation Approach

We're following a **systems thinking methodology** with four distinct phases:

1. **Foundation First**: Create comprehensive SAFe knowledge base
2. **Templates Before Agents**: Define all SAFe artifacts and document specifications
3. **Processes Before Personas**: Map information flows and organizational processes
4. **Agents as Process Facilitators**: Design purpose-built agents for specific process steps

## Project Structure

- `phase-1-foundation/` - SAFe framework knowledge base
- `phase-2-templates/` - SAFe artifacts and document templates
- `phase-3-processes/` - Information flows and organizational processes
- `phase-4-agents/` - SAFe-aligned agents and responsibilities
- `implementation-notes/` - Progress tracking and implementation comments

## Quick Reference

- [Phase 1: Foundation](phase-1-foundation/README.md)
- [Phase 2: Templates](phase-2-templates/README.md)
- [Phase 3: Processes](phase-3-processes/README.md)
- [Phase 4: Agents](phase-4-agents/README.md)

## Implementation Status

- [ ] Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Phase 2: Templates
- [ ] Phase 3: Processes
- [ ] Phase 4: Agents

## Key Principles

1. **Systems Thinking**: Build a cohesive system, not isolated components
2. **Dependency Management**: Each phase builds on the previous one
3. **Quality Assurance**: Templates ensure consistent outputs
4. **Process Efficiency**: Information flows are optimized before automation
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
